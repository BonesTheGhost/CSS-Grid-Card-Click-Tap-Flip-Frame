# CSS-Grid-Card-Click-Tap-Flip-Frame
A separate small repo to experiment with getting CSS cards to flip while inside of a responsive CSS grid layout.

## Changelog:
[001]: Initial Commit >> Added all of the base files from local. CSS Grid established. Click listeners added. Basic Animation Added. Need to polish.
[002-0.0.2]: Getting Closer >> Tweaked the CSS classes for touch, and the animations are now working closer to expetected.
[003-0.0.3]: Animations still not working. Will try to fix shortly. Can get either the front to animate properly, or the back but not both.
[004-0.0.4]: Managed to make all 3 cards flip on tap for the mobile version. However, the flip only occurs if the text area is clicked (probably due to that having specific front or back associated with it) and the flip-back animation doesn't play i.e it occurs instantly. Also, two of the three cards start with their backs presented but the first one presents the front for some reason.
